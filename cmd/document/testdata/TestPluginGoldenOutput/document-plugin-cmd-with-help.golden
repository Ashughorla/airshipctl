Subcommand reads configuration file CONFIG passed as
a first argument and determines a particular plugin to execute. Additional
arguments may be passed to this sub-command abd can be used by the
particular plugin. CONFIG file must be structured as kubernetes
manifest (i.e. resource) and must have 'apiVersion' and 'kind' keys.

Example:
$ cat /tmp/generator.yaml
---
apiVersion: airshipit.org/v1alpha1
kind: ReplacementTransformer
metadata:
  name: notImportantHere
replacements:
- source:
    value: nginx:newtag
  target:
    objref:
      kind: Deployment
    fieldrefs:
    - spec.template.spec.containers[name=nginx-latest].image

$ airshipctl document plugin /tmp/generator.yaml

subcommand will try to identify appropriate plugin using apiVersion and
kind keys (a.k.a group, version, kind) as an identifier. If appropriate
plugin was not found command returns an error.

Usage:
  plugin CONFIG [ARGS] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for plugin
